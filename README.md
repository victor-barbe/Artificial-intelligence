# Artificial-intelligence

This repository will contain various artificial intelligence projects

## Description

These artificial intelligence project were created for my engineering classes, or either by personnal interest.

## 1. `Newton's gradient `

The goal of this project it to take a function of the form ax^2 + bx + c with a a matrix, b a vector and c a number, all defined in the real numbers. Then we have to find the lowest part of the function using newton's gradient method.

## 2. `Genetic algorithm `

The goal of this project it to take a function of the form ax^2 + bx + c with a a matrix, b a vector and c a number, all defined in the real numbers. The genetic algorithm will have to find the lowest point of the function.$

## 3. `Chess game `

The goal of this project is to create a complete chess game, with an artificial intelligence based on the min max algorithm
