# Artificial-intelligence

This repository will contain various artificial intelligence projects

## Description

These artificial intelligence project were created for my engineering classes, or either by personnal interest.

## 1. `Newton's gradient `

The goal of this project it to take a function of the form ax^2 + bx + c with a a matrix, b a vector and c a number, all defined in the real numbers. Then we have to find the lowest part of the function using newton's gradient method.

## 2. `Genetic algorithm `

The goal of this project it to take a function of the form ax^2 + bx + c with a a matrix, b a vector and c a number, all defined in the real numbers. The genetic algorithm will have to find the lowest point of the function.$

## 3. `Chess game `

The goal of this project is to create a complete chess game, with an artificial intelligence based on the min max algorithm

## 4. `Event prediction in a bayesian network`

This project should base its work on a JSON file defining different events, their probability and the links between events. Then here are its functionalities:

1. It should print out the nodes forming a Markov blanket for the selected variable

2. accepts evidence – which sets the observed variables of specific nodes

3. Be able to answer simple queries – i.e. it returns the probability distribution of the
   selected query variables

4. To perform these, it should use MCMC algorithm with GIBBS sampling

## 5. `Classification`

1. This program distinguishes cancer versus normal patterns from mass-spectrometric data based on the dataset:
   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arcene

2. We use at least two separate methods (Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting) and compare them to each other, the solution is resolved as a classifier. We compare accuracy on the training set and on the test set.

## 6. `Artificial neuronal network`

## 7. `Q-Learning algorithm and the Taxi problem`
